### Short Description of the Problem
We look to address the third problem statement â€“ integrating with a smart environment. We will narrow our scope to reporting traffic incidents and we leverage technology to accomplish these three tasks: 
1. To make better and more timely sense of emergency incidents. 
2. To trigger early intervention measures such as notifying the traffic police to quickly restore traffic conditions at the incident site. 
3. To flag to SCDF and activate emergency resources such as ambulances only when a major traffic accident occurs.
